Lightweight Free API Testing Tool

## Reason
Existing API testing tools often consume excessive computer resources and have transitioned to paid or partially paid models.

## Idea
Create a completely free, lightweight, and fast API testing tool.

## Note
This tool is developed by a Java developer for fellow Java developers who already have JRE/JDK installed.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following external libraries:

- [JavaFx](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/) — GUI
- [OkHTTP](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) - HTTP Request
- [PicoContainer](http://picocontainer.com/) — DI
- [jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/) - JSON
